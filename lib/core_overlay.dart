/// The `core-overlay` element displays overlayed on top of other content. It starts
/// out hidden and is displayed by setting its `opened` property to true.
/// A `core-overlay's` opened state can be toggled by calling the `toggle`
/// method.
///
/// The `core-overlay` will, by default, show/hide itself when it's opened. The
/// `target` property may be set to another element to cause that element to
/// be shown when the overlay is opened.
///
/// It's common to want a `core-overlay` to animate to its opened
/// position. The `core-overlay` element uses a `core-transition` to handle
/// animation. The default transition is `core-transition-fade` which
/// causes the overlay to fade in when displayed. See
/// <a href="../core-transition/">`core-transition`</a> for more
/// information about customizing a `core-overlay's` opening animation. The
/// `backdrop` property can be set to true to show a backdrop behind the overlay
/// that will darken the rest of the window.
///
/// An element that should close the `core-overlay` will automatically
/// do so if it's given the `core-overlay-toggle` attribute. This attribute
/// can be customized with the `closeAttribute` property. You can also use
/// `closeSelector` if more general matching is needed.
///
/// By default  `core-overlay` will close whenever the user taps outside it or
/// presses the escape key. This behavior can be turned off via the
/// `autoCloseDisabled` property.
///

///       <h2>Dialog</h2>

/// following rules. If the target's style.top and style.left are unset, the
/// target will be centered. The size of the target is constrained to be no larger
/// than the window dimensions. The `margin` property specifies the extra amount
/// of space that should be reserved around the overlay. This can be used to ensure
/// that, for example, a drop shadow is always visible around the overlay.
